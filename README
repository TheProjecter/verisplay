iVerilog Display extension

This shared library is an extension meant to be used with iVerilog, it allows for graphical debugging output, and is useful for the design
of graphics processor simulations.  It is released under the GPL V2 license.

This iVerilog module is simple to use.  Compilation is easy, the Makefile should explain quick usage, and implementation is just as easy.
This library requires OpenGL, GLUT, and the iVerilog VPI extensions.  The c file containing the LCD simulation code might need to be
modified to change the include path for the vpi_user.h file, depending on your linux distro, but that should be about it.


Essentially, the extension consists of 3 different functions.  init_lcd(h,w,speed) plot(x,y,r,g,b), and redraw();

The included testbench file shows a very quick example implementation.  The only thing you really need to consider is that the plot
function is plotting twice as fast as the simulation is changing coordinate data, and is doing so continuously.  This might not be the
most efficient, but unfortunately the Nyquist rate had to be observed in this implementation in order for the display to work.  Redraw is
not necessary as the display will update after a H*W pixel plots are made.

The speed flat is simply a numerical value of 0 or 1. 0 will cause slow operation, where the display is redrawn after every plot.  This
is really, really slow, however useful when debugging specific graphics functions.  A value of 1 will cause a fast plot, where the screen is
redrawn every H*W pixel plots (assuming the pixels are being plotted at the raster's Nyquist rate.)
